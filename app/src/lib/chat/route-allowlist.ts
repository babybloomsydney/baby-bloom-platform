/**
 * Build the "Valid URLs" allowlist that gets injected into Katie's
 * system prompt at request time.
 *
 * Source of truth: `public/katie-manifest.json`, regenerated at every
 * build by `scripts/generate-katie-manifest.mjs`. Reading the manifest
 * (instead of hardcoding) means the list is always current — every
 * time someone adds or removes a page, the allowlist updates on the
 * next deploy without anyone editing a separate document.
 *
 * Why this exists: Katie was caught in production fabricating URLs
 * (e.g. claiming a "Hidden" toggle at /nanny/profile that doesn't
 * exist in the UI, or pointing at /nanny/edit-profile which 404s).
 * A tight allowlist plus an explicit "do not invent" rule makes that
 * class of hallucination structurally impossible.
