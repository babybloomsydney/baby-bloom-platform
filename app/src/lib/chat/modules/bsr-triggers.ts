/**
 * Proactive triggers for the BSR (babysitting) module.
 *
 * Template-mode throughout — babysitting events are time-sensitive,
 * and the nanny already has a visible inbox on the main page; our
 * role is to surface a short narrated nudge in the chat deck so the
 * user doesn't miss it.
 *
 * NEVER include the nanny's phone or parent's address in any
 * template. The main-site UI handles contact reveal at the right
 * stage; chat narration stays high-level.
 *
 * Design note for template copy: earlier versions of these templates
 * used "{family_name} just booked you" + the caller passed
 * family_name: "The", producing "The just booked you". Now the
 * template doesn't prepend/append words around the name — the caller
 * passes the complete phrase to avoid grammar breakage when the
 * real name isn't resolvable. See commit TODO.
